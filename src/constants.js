  pc: `This is my PC, and it’s honestly my best friend! I mostly use it for creating assignments and, of course, watching K-dramas on Netflix! 
    As a computer engineering student, this PC is super important to me. It’s my trusty partner in crime for everything— 
    from tackling assignments and coding projects to staying connected with friends on social media. This PC helps me get through the crazy school days and is my go-to 
    for both productivity and relaxation. Whether I’m diving into my studies or watching my favorite shows, it keeps me going. 
    It’s my multitasking powerhouse that never lets me down—whether I’m working hard or just unwinding with some entertainment. I can’t imagine life without it!`,

    - I placed 3rd in a marathon (yep, I love a good challenge!) 🏃‍♀️

    - And last but not least, I was a Senior High School Representative, which gave me the chance to lead and help organize school activities! 💪✨`,
  
    "sofa-table": `This is my sofa, my ultimate relaxation spot after school. It's where I kick back, scroll through TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and just take a break from the hustle and bustle. 
    I love unwinding here with a cozy blanket, sipping on something sweet, and catching up on everything I missed. But this is also where I work on my crochet! 
    Whether it's creating something new or perfecting a piece, this is where my crochet projects come to life. Oh, and if you're curious, this is also where I connect with everyone!

  tv: `This is my TV, and it's definitely one of my favorite things in the house! It’s where I catch up on the news and stay in the loop with everything happening around the world. 
    But it’s not all serious stuff—I also love using it for cozy movie nights with my family and friends! Whether it's a rom-com marathon or a thrilling movie night, 
    we always have so much fun. It's the perfect spot to just relax, unwind, and enjoy some quality time together, wrapped in blankets with some snacks (and maybe a little popcorn)!`,
 
  bed: `This is my bed, my cozy haven where I sleep and recharge after long, hectic days. It’s my favorite place to relax, especially after a rough week of school! 
    As a computer engineering student, life can be a constant struggle with assignments, projects, and deadlines. But here in my bed, I can finally unwind and let it all go. 
    I love curling up with soft blankets, resting my tired body, and letting my mind drift. Some of my best ideas come when I’m lying here, but if I don’t write them down, 
    I can’t sleep! It's like my brain won’t stop running until I get those ideas out. This is also where I work on my crochet, making cute little creations when I need a break 
    from studying. It’s the perfect spot to relax, dream big, and get ready to take on the next day!`,

  library: `I have a lovely little collection of books on my shelves, and most of them I bought from the National Book Store! 
    I absolutely adore them. Some of my favorites include *Lucid Dream*, *School for Good and Evil*, *The Lost Hero*, *Mockingjay*, and *Catching Fire*. 
    These books take me to magical worlds, full of adventure, mystery, and unforgettable characters. 
    Even though I haven’t read all of them cover to cover just yet, I love having them close by for when I need to escape into a good story. 
    Who else buys books because they just can't resist them, even if they haven’t finished the last one? Guilty as charged! 
    If you're interested in checking out these books or any others, you can check the website of <a href="https://www.nationalbookstore.com/" target="_blank">NBS</a> to see the books you like!`,
